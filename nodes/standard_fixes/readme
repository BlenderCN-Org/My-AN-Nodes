# Fixes to standard AN Nodes

This folder contains any fixes to standard nodes that I have altered, so they work better for me, they are not approved by AN developers, but have been properly tested.

21 March 2019 get_selected_objects.py added, to replace non-working one in standard AN 2.1 for Blender 2.8.
